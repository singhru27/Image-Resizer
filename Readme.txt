Project Overview:

This allows you to dynamically resize an image, removing "seams" of pixels that are deemed to be the least important (smallest changes in RGB values). 

Run Instructions:
1. Include the four included JARs as external JARS
2. Fill in the absolute path of the default file path you would like to seamcarve in App.java (this can be changed in the visualizer using the "File" button
3. Adjust the slider to see the visualizer take effect!


Alternatively a POM file has been included if looking to use Maven. cs0160.jar and nds4.jar are custom made local JAR files, and thus will need to be added to your local Maven repository (make sure to match the artifact ID given in the POM file).
